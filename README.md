**RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. Optimize Fixture Scheduling to Maximize Attendance

Concentrate high-profile matches on Saturdays and Sundays.
Avoid scheduling key games on Mondays or Fridays unless supported by strategic marketing campaigns or promotions.

2. Leverage High-Attendance Teams for Broader Engagement

Feature clubs like Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham in more televised primetime slots.
Offer partnership packages (e.g., merchandise or promotions) around high-attendance games.

3. Support Low-Attendance Teams with Marketing & Infrastructure

Provide support to teams like Everton and Chelsea to enhance fan experience, boost marketing, or consider stadium expansion if capacity limits attendance.

4. Improve Midweek Game Attendance

Introduce discounts, family bundles, or interactive halftime experiences to boost turnout on weekdays.
Promote digital streaming or virtual engagement for fans who can’t attend in person.

5. Highlight Competitive Balance in Promotions

Use statistics showing close scoring margins across teams to market the league's unpredictability and excitement.
This could improve global viewership and engagement by showing the league is not dominated by just one team.

6. Referee Performance Analytics

Consider analyzing referee impact on game flow, fouls, and outcomes.
Transparency here can help improve trust and decision quality while assigning referees for key fixtures.
